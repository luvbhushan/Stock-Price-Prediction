This GitHub repository contains a Python implementation of a stock price prediction model using time series analysis. The code leverages historical stock data for State Bank of India (SBIN) and applies a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to forecast future stock prices.

Key Steps and Techniques Used
Data Loading:

Utilized the Pandas library to load historical stock data from an Excel file (Quote-Equity-SBIN-EQ-15-07-2021-to-15-07-2022.xlsx).
Set the 'Date' column as the index for time series analysis.
Data Visualization and Exploration:

Used Matplotlib to visualize the closing prices over time.
Checked the basic information about the dataset using the info() function.
Data Preprocessing:

Extracted the 'close' prices for analysis.
Reshaped and transformed the data using MinMaxScaler for normalization.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Time Series Generator:

Employed the TimeseriesGenerator from TensorFlow to create sequences of data for training the model.
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model:

Built a Sequential model using Keras.
Added a SimpleRNN layer with 30 units as the input layer.
Introduced a Dropout layer to prevent overfitting.
Appended a Dense layer with a single neuron for prediction.
Compiled the model using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error (MSE) loss.
Model Training:

Trained the model using the training data generated by the TimeseriesGenerator.
Utilized 10 epochs and disabled shuffling during training.
Model Evaluation:

Visualized the training loss over epochs using Matplotlib.
Prediction and Evaluation:

Created a test batch for initial evaluation.
Used the trained model to predict future stock prices.
Inverted the scaling to obtain true price predictions.
Compared the model predictions with the actual test data.
How to Use:
Clone the repository and run the provided Python script.
Ensure necessary dependencies, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow, are installed.
